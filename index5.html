    <h3>WHAT NEEDS TO CHANGE</h3>
    <p> All throughout history, women have always struggled with several social injustices. For several years, women were not allowed to vote and we deemed less than men. There has also been the pay wage gap that has been seen in all work fields. Even though women have had their share of struggles, we have managed to continue to thrive and get more of a voice. We must continue to push for equality in all genders.</p>

          <h4>GAP IN PAY WAGE</h4>
          <p> The gender pay wage gap has been one of the most controversial topics in the last few years. However, the statistics stand. Women earn just about 79 cents for every dollar men make in 2019. Latina women have a pay gap of 58% of a men's salary, Black women have a pay gap of 65%, and White women have a pay gap of 82%. As you can see, not only are women are discriminated against men, but women of color are treated even worse. </p>

          <h4>Voting and other Injustices</h4>
          <p> One of the biggest injustices that women have gone through has been not being able to vote. For years, women marched and protested for their rights until they were given the right to vote in August 18, 1920. 100 years ago, women faced a tremendous amount of unfairness including holding property, serve on jury, have a bank account, become a lawyer, have a right to a safe abortion, and much more. We have come a long way when looking back on the last century and must continue to move towards equal rights.</p>
